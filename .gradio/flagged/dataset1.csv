If John is 24, how old is Mary?
The answer is 16","To find Mary's age, let's break down the information given:

1. John is 24 years old.
2. John is twice as old as Mary was when John was as old as Mary is now.

Let's denote Mary's current age as 'x'. 

Since John is as old as Mary is now, John's age at that time is also 'x'. 

According to the information, John is twice as old as Mary was when John was as old as Mary is now. This means John's current age (24) is twice Mary's age at that time. 

So, we can write the equation: 24 = 2 * x

To find Mary's age, we need to solve for 'x'. 

Divide both sides of the equation by 2: 
x = 24 / 2
x = 12

However, this is not the correct answer. Let's re-evaluate the information given.

The correct interpretation is: John is twice as old as Mary was when John was as old as Mary is now. 

Let's denote Mary's current age as 'x'.
